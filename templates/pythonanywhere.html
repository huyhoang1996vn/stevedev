              Storage capacities have always been a debating problem amongst
              developers. Some people still use local storage. However, I hold a
              trong favor for an
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Object storage service</span> such
              as <span class="font-weight-bold">Minio</span> or
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Amazon S3</span> (Amazon Simple
              Storage Service).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Object storage</span> is
              unstructured data which people frequently see images, videos and
              so on. They have a range size from several KB to milition GB.
              Applications always have to save these files and even pay
              enormously. Storage assignment is significant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Normally, developers put data files in local storage. There are
              several disadvantages when doing that. So, developers have
              considered storage servers. Nowaday,
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Object storage service</span> is
              more popular for several reasons.
            </p>
            <h3>Scalability</h3>
            <p>
              Local storage often depends on physical hardware. Once the maximum
              limit of the local storage is reached, people have to add new
              space, which does not resist downtime. Conversely, Minio has
              virtually unlimited storage. That means, this service allows
              people to broaden storage anytime not to be concerned.
            </p>
            <h3>High secure</h3>
            <p>
              Data stored in your Minio environment is protected from
              unauthorized access thanks to encryption features and access
              management tools. Hackers do not have ability to get exact path of
              file in server.
            </p>
            <h3>Policies</h3>
            <p>
              Minio even allows creating users and groups. Moreover, Minio has
              policies to define actions or resources which users can access.
              Now, teammates can share resources in minio without concerned
              permissions.
            </p>
            <h3>Support distribution</h3>
            <p>
              Distribution is essential in the state of the art system,
              especially micro services. Minio is totally appropriate to this
              system. However, this is really a bigger topic. I will explain in
              next article. Details in

            <p>Letâ€™s create tutorial with minio and python.</p>
            <p>Create minio with docker like that</p>
            <div
              class="termy"
              data-termynal
              data-ty-typeDelay="40"
              data-ty-lineDelay="1000"
            >
              <span data-ty="input"
                >docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -e
                "MINIO_ROOT_USER=yourusername" -e
                "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourpassword" -d -v /minio/data:/data
                --name minio minio/minio server /data</span
              >
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              <img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}images/minio.png" alt="Minio" />
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Another Minio image</p>
            <div
              class="termy1"
              data-termynal
              data-ty-typeDelay="40"
              data-ty-lineDelay="1000"
            >
              <span data-ty="input"
                >docker run \ -p 9000:9000 \ -p 9001:9001 \ --name minio-server
                \ -d \ -v /minio-server/data:/data \ -e
                "MINIO_ROOT_USER=yourusername" \ -e
                "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourpassword" \ quay.io/minio/minio server
                /data --console-address ":9001"
              </span>
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              <img
                src="{{ STATIC_URL }}images/minio-console.png"
                alt="Minio Console"
              />
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              On the other hand, Mino explicitly supports python language in the
              offical document
              <a
                href="https://docs.min.io/docs/python-client-api-reference.html"
                target="_blank"
                >python-client-api</a
              >

              developers just follow and enjoy it. For example:
            </p>
            <br />

            <pre>
            <code>
              from minio import Minio
              from config import setting_project # This is my config

              client = Minio(
                  setting_project.minio_url,
                  access_key=setting_project.minio_access_key,
                  secret_key=setting_project.minio_secret_key,
                  secure=setting_project.minio_secure
              )
              found = client.bucket_exists(setting_project.minio_bucket)
              if not found:
                  client.make_bucket(setting_project.minio_bucket)


              // create 
              client.put_object(
                          setting_project.minio_bucket, file_location, file.file, len(byte_file)
                      )
              // get 
              data = client.get_object(setting_project.minio_bucket, path)
            </code>
          </pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In summary, Object storage services would reap more benefits in
              handling data. Developers do not bother to scale systems which
              exceed capacity. OSS also supports distributed very well and
              completely.
